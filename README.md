== Welcome to Pario

Pario is a game building framework that aims to give structure and quick start for creating games with the Ruby programming language. It uses the Gosu graphric library.

== Installation

	`gem install pario`
	`brew install libgosu`

	* Gosu will automatically be installed when you install pario

== Getting Started

1. At the command prompt, create a new Pario application:

	pario new my_game

2. Change the directory to my_game and start the game:

	pario play

3. Add more classes to the game:

	pario add my_class
	
	* Pario will create more than one class if you have more: pario add star background player
